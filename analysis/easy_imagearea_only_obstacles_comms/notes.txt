these results are for CBGA given actions 11 and 13 fail
they are recovered by fault handling and then the final two tasks are done
there are four robots on the team, but only two operating because the BT is incomplete


CBBA results are same input as CBGA except NO FAULTS

Note this is with old planning
Coverage with obstacles is glitchy
but data should be fine

If we update planning, should be faster
But fair comparison between CBBA and CBGA either way because same planners

this is for domain:
input_15p_10obs_noblocks

but we change CBGA,CBBA or number of faults
Not testing random faults with averaging results yet
