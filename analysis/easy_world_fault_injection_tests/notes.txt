results in this directory are from the small/easy world domain
but not the final final one, just the input_15p_10obs_noblocks
Some have bundle size 3, but better with 4 for safety (esp around isstuckwaiting logic)

Note, actions 23 and 24 are clearpath, co-op, group size of 2

Given the team in this domain is 2 mapper (cant do that task) and 2 samplers (which can)
Team CANNOT recover from fault 23 or 24. So reward will be lower, the earlier in the path task 9 or 10 appears.
Task 9 is action 23, and task 10 is 24.
I think this is ok. It won't happen every run and CBGA should still do better than all other methods.

Currently, greedy is allowed to succeed accidentally on co-op tasks. Preventing it broke stuff for CBBA/CBGA.

Greedy may have higher reward than CBBA, but CBBA will finish faster.
CBGA should always get at least as well as greedy, almost always more, and should be faster.
CBGA will likely be slower than CBBA, but higher reward always.



Note that we have a run with 2 mappers and 3 samplers since the group size for coop tasks is 2, fair to have 1 over that to allow potential to recover.
No faults were injected in current run we have, but we will include results when we fix fault recovery for coop tasks.
